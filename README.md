This is my Task Tracker! 

I realized while doing this project I must admit that this was absolutely a journey from beginning to end.
There were multiple things in this task tracker that I have been struggling with like for example, Getting my buttons to be functional
I figured out how to get them functional but the issue is that the "edit" button will not work no matter how much I click on it. 
the "edit" button is functional but after awhile it stops working , and I have been doing everything from, editing the code, double checking the javascript, refereshing
my live server/VSCode. LITERALLY EVERYTHING. I just believe that it takes some time, but for now, I do acknowledge it is and should be functional.

Another difficulty that I have been having is FS and LocalStorage, I've looked up multiple resources and tried to get help multiple times on these topics, and I honestly
still have trouble knowing how to do the FS, so I only did what I knew how to do to the best of my abilities and commented everything that I knew.
I've done everything I've possibly could do at this point, I know that I have improved on doing figuring out my Media Queries, I did eventually figure out the localstorage And I am starting to get a little better trying to understand Javascript.

But as I said before, I think all of this has been a a huge journey, yes, I will admit there are few bumps and bruises that I REALLY need to patch up
on, and I will still continue to acknowledge and fix my errors in the future. But overall, I'm super proud pf myself and all that I have accomplished with this project.
